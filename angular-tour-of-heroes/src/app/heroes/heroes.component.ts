    // The new version waits for the Observable to emit the array of heroesâ€”which could happen now or several minutes from now. The subscribe() method passes the emitted array to the callback, which sets the component's heroes property.

    // This asynchronous approach will work when the HeroService requests heroes from the server.

  //  Angular calls it shortly after creating a component. good place to put initialization logic
